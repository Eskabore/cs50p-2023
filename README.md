# Welcome to My CS50P GitHub Repository!

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository for the **CS50P (Programming with Python)** course! This is a curated showcase of my journey through the course, illustrating my accomplishments and the knowledge I've gained along the way.

## Problem Sets and Projects

Within this repository, you'll find a diverse collection of problem sets that I've diligently completed as part of the CS50P curriculum. Each problem set serves as a practical exercise that reinforces essential principles in computer science and programming. These exercises span a broad range of topics, from foundational understanding of algorithms and data structures, to the exploration of more advanced areas such as web development and artificial intelligence. The variety and depth of these exercises effectively chart my growth and proficiency in different facets of computer science.

## Final Project

Uncomplete: `task-queue`
Completed: `image-editor`

# Important Notice

While I'm excited to share my work with you, I strongly urge visitors not to copy the code for their own problem sets. This repository is intended to serve as an illustration of my personal journey and progress in the CS50P course, rather than a source for direct solutions.

**Remember: The learning value in programming comes from facing and overcoming challenges yourself.**

Feel free to explore, get inspired, and use this repository as a reference point, but ensure you adhere to the principles of academic integrity and honest learning.

Thank you for your understanding, and happy coding!
