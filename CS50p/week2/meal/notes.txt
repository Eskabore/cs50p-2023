his code first checks if the suffix is present in the input string.
If it is, it splits the string into the time and suffix, converts the hours and minutes to integers, and adjusts the hours if the suffix is "p.m.".
If the suffix is not present, the code splits the string into hours and minutes and converts them to integers.
Finally, the function returns the total number of hours as a float.
