The calculate function takes an expression as input, splits it into its constituent parts, performs the appropriate arithmetic operation, formats the result
as a float with one decimal place, and prints it to the console.
The main program prompts the user for an expression, passes it to the calculate function, and outputs the result.

In the [optimized] implementation, I have:

- Simplified the conversion of x and y to integers by using a tuple instead of two separate assignments
- Used a dictionary to map the operator to the appropriate function, which eliminates the need for an if-else chain
- Used the mapped function to perform the arithmetic operation, which is more concise and easier to read
