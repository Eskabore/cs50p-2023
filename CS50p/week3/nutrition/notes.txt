The original `fruit_calories` dictionary is first converted to lowercase keys using a dictionary comprehension,
similar to the code I provided earlier. This ensures that the program is case-insensitive when looking up the calorie counts for a fruit.

Then, the program prompts the user to enter a fruit input and converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
The program then checks if the fruit exists in the `fruit_calories` dictionary using the lowercase version of the input,
and outputs the corresponding calorie count if it does.
If the fruit doesn't exist in the dictionary, the program outputs an error message.
