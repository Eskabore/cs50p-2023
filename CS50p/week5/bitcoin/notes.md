This is a program that takes a command-line argument specifying the number of Bitcoins to buy, queries the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index API for the current price of Bitcoin, and computes the value of the user's Bitcoins in USD. The output is a string that displays the number of Bitcoins and the value in USD with a thousands separator.

Here's a line-by-line explanation of the program:

```python
import sys
import requests`
```

The program imports the `sys` and `requests` modules.

```python
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    sys.exit("Usage: python bitcoin.py <address>")
```

The program checks if the user has provided a command-line argument. If not, it prints an error message and exits the program.

```python
try:
	n = float(sys.argv[1])
except ValueError:
	sys.exit("Usage: python bitcoin.py <address>")`

```

The program tries to convert the command-line argument to a float. If the conversion fails, it prints an error message and exits the program.

```python
try:
    response = requests.get("https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json")
    response.raise_for_status()
    data = response.json()
    price = data['bpi']['USD']['rate_float']
except requests.RequestException:
    sys.exit("Error: API request failed")

```

The program queries the CoinDesk API for the current price of Bitcoin. If an error occurs while querying the API, it prints an error message and exits the program.

```python
amount = n * price
print(f"{n} BTC is worth ${amount:,.4f}")
```

The program computes the value of the user's Bitcoins in USD and prints the result with a thousands separator using f-strings.
