### `project.py`

In the `main()` function, we first load the image using the `load_image()` function and store it in the `image` variable. Then, we resize the image using the `resize_image()` function and store the resized image in the `resized_image` variable. Next, we convert the resized image to black and white using the `convert_to_bw()` function and store the resulting image in the `bw_image` variable. Finally, we save the black and white image to a file using the `save_image()` function.
