"""
This version uses `re.search` to find the first occurrence of "um" in the input string `s`, and then enters a loop to find subsequent occurrences. The loop continues as long as `re.search` finds a match, and increments the counter for each match. The `while` loop updates the `s` variable by removing the portion of the string up to the end of the last match, and then calls `re.search` again to find the next match in the updated string. The final count is returned after the loop has completed.

"""
In this updated implementation, we use a `try`-`except` block to catch any exceptions that may be raised when trying to read input from the user. We then check that the input is a string using `isinstance`, and raise a `TypeError` if it is not.

If an error is caught, we print an error message and exit the program with a non-zero status code using `sys.exit(1)`. This will indicate to the calling process that the program failed to run successfully.

With this error handling in place, the program will now gracefully handle the case where the user does not input a string.
