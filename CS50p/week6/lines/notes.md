This is a Python program that reads a file specified by the user as a command-line argument and counts the number of lines of code in the file, excluding comments and blank lines.

The program first checks that exactly one command-line argument is provided and that the argument ends with ".py", to ensure that the user has provided a valid Python file.

It then attempts to open the file and read its contents using the `open()` and `readlines()` functions, respectively. If the file cannot be opened, the program exits with an error message.

The program then loops through each line of the file and uses various checks to determine whether the line is a comment, a multi-line comment, or a blank line. If the line is none of these, it is counted as a line of code.

Finally, the program prints the total number of lines of code counted to the console.

Overall, this program demonstrates how to read and process text files in Python, as well as how to use command-line arguments and various string manipulation functions. It is a good exercise in writing efficient and maintainable code, and in understanding how to handle different types of input and edge cases.
